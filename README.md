# Prototype Program for Beginner Musicians

This is a prototype of a program designed for beginner musicians. Currently, it provides a simple way to view major and minor chords in a user-friendly interface, helping with learning and practicing these fundamental chords.

## Features

- **Major Chord Visualization**: Displays the most common major chords for the user.
- **Minor Chord Visualization**: Displays the most common minor chords.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- The following Python libraries:
  - `tkinter` (for creating the GUI)
  - `Pillow` (for image processing)
  - `requests` (for handling HTTP requests)

## How to Use

1. **Installation**: (If the program needs to be installed, add installation instructions here)
   - Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/beginner-musician-project.git
     ```
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd tonehero-master
     ```

2. **Running the Program**:
   - Run the program using the following command:
     ```bash
     python tonehero.py
     ```

3. **Navigation**:
   - The interface will display the available chords (major and minor).
   - Select the desired chord to view its formation and learn how to play it.

## Technologies Used
